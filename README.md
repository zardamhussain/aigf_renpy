This Ren’Py TTS Demo shows how to wire up AI‑powered text‑to‑speech in your visual novel with minimum fuss. sending each to a remote TTS endpoint and playing back the resulting MP3 (or browser‑Audio blob) on a dedicated music channel. While speech is playing, switches your character’s image from an “idle” pose to a “talking” pose, then back again when the audio ends.
